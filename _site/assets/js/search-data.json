    "content": "When something breaks in a forest, does it make a noise? . Introduction . And when something breaks in a FileMaker database, does it log an error? . When moving code around, patching files, or generally copy + pasting stuff from A to B, it‚Äôs quite easy to break things. FileMaker tries to help in the form of the import.log which gets written to every time you paste something in, but‚Ä¶ . The Problems . | The import.log is hard to read | Some problems are not logged as errors | Errors from cancelled imports are hard to recognise | Finding the error in the log is one thing, finding the original error is another | Custom functions errors are not logged | In Layout Mode there is no logging at all | . MrWatson‚Äôs Solutions . MrWatson has a solution for everything . For Mastering the import.log . First and foremost you need fmLogAnalyser to help you read the import.log, and the BugOff! Alarm to tell you when you‚Äôve broken something. This solves problems 1-3. Errors and warnings (e.g. thing ‚Äòx‚Äô imported as thing ‚Äòx 2‚Äô) are highlighted and a big green OK button tells you your import was successful. For problem 4, you need to add fmIDE to your solution. Then it needs approximately a single click to get to the error in your solution The tonic you need is . Problem 5 and 6, errors in Custom Functions and Layouts, have to be solved differently, since they are not logged. For this you need . | fmCheckMate (part of fmWorkMate) | fmCheckMate XSLT-Library! | and, of course, the MBS Plugin | . For Custom Functions . ‚Ä¶after you paste them in, but before you close the Custom Functions dialog,‚Ä¶ . | Copy the Custom Functions back to the clipboard | With fmCheckMate convert them to XML | Click [T] (or press‚åòT) to choose an XSLT transformation | Select the analysis function ‚ÄúList functions that seem to be commented out‚Äù | You get a list of suspect CFs | . If the list is empty, you can go back and save the custom functions, and if not you can break off, fix the problems and repeat. For Layouts . | Copy the layout objects back to the clipboard | With fmCheckMate convert them to XML | Click [T] (or press‚åòT) to choose an XSLT transformation | Select the analysis function ‚ÄúLayout Analysis‚Äù | You get a neat list of all the errors and warnings in the layout | .

FileMaker has a pretty neat debugger, with a very useful button for editing the current script, which allows you to open the script and break off the debugging. It‚Äôs a quick way to get to a script directly from a button or process,‚Ä¶ however‚Ä¶ . The Problem . when you edit the currently running script, you get a standalone editing window for editing the steps of the script, which lacks many of the niceties of being in the script workspace. For example, you are not able to see where the script is in the script tree, or to duplicate the script. Morevover, there is no way to easily get back to editing this script in the Script Workspace, other than closing the window, opening the Script workspace and going to find the same script (and good luck with that!) .

The problem is that since the FileMaker clipboard only contains field calculations as a string, the calculation must be parsed. Since I am no rocket scientist, that means fmGraphIt builds its list of field dependencies by just looking (relatively unintelligently) for occurrences of the field names in the calculations. Sometimes fmGraphIt gets it wrong, for example fmGraphIt ignores relationships, so if a referenced field in a related table has the same name as a field in the current table, fmGraphIt will incorrectly consider this as a reference to a field in the current table. See ‚ÄòHow fmGraphIt works‚Äô to get a better understanding of its limits. ",

In other words: . With ‚Äòopen file on start‚Äô FileMaker ignores the user‚Äôs request to open a different file.

    "content": "P-T-Oh! ‚Ä¶ Gotcha! . Have you ever added a new field to a table only to find that the calculation context is not what you expected? . This can be quite problematic, since, with the wrong calculation context, the calculation can produce quite incorrect results. PTO = Primary Table Occurence = the ‚Äòmain‚Äô table occurence . It‚Äôs also quite unepected and confusing‚Ä¶because, taking a look at the relationship graph, everything appears to be alright: . | You can see the PTO which is used for your layouts - in this case the _Mandanten TO with the underscore at the start | and the other ‚Äòrelated TOs‚Äô - with the table name ‚ÄòMandant‚Äô at the end. | . [At GBS we have a naming convention that prefixes the base table and the PTO with an underscore, so that the PTO is always the first TO in the table picker list.] . All seems well, but clearly it is not. So, what‚Äôs going on? . The Problem . The problem is you have (passively or actively) created an Imposter PTO in your file! . ‚Ä¶either through negligence or as a product of resturcturing your database. What are Imposter PTOs? . A PTO - the Primary Table Occurence of a table - is‚Ä¶ . | the TO you ususally use for layouts | the TO that you expect to appear in the calculation context of a calculation field | however, it must be the base table‚Äôs first TO created in the file | . On the other hand, an Imposter PTO is‚Ä¶ . | a TO that looks like it‚Äôs the primary table occurence of a table (according to your naming conventions), but‚Ä¶ | it is not the first TO in the file. | . So here you see (what you think is) the PTO at the bottom left plus a couple of related TOs. This typically occurs . | when the developer is inattentive and accidentally uses the first TO as a related TO to some other table | when a table is imported into a file, where a refernce to the table already exists as a related TO to some other table | . So what? . What are the consequences of having an Imposter PTO? . Imposter PTOs can cause problems with calculations in new fields, because the default calculation context is not the TO you expect it to be. This is best illustrated with an example: . User Story: Imposter PTO caused by Refactoring the Database . Say . | your naming practice is to prefix your BaseTables and PTOs with an underscore | you initially have two files to store your invoice data | . This may be the inital set up . | File Invoices.fmp12 . | base table _Invoices | PTO _Invoices | related TO Invoices.InvoiceLineItems | . | File InvoiceLineItems.fmp12 . | base table _InvoiceLineItems, | PTO _InvoiceLineItems | related TO InvoicesLineItems.Invoice | . | . At first all is well and good, but some day the double work of maintaining two files becomes too much overhead and you decide to refactor your database and put everything into the Invoices.fmp12 file. You do this by . | importing the InvoiceLineItems table perfectly into the Invoices.fmp12 file. | Copying the layout + script code over to the Invoices.fmp12 file | Removing all references to the InvoicesLineItems file | Deleting the InvoicesLineItems file | Testing and fixing (mostly, Go to Related Record steps where the Target Layout has broken) | . The structure you now have is like this: . | File Invoices.fmp12 . | base table _Invoices | PTO _Invoices | related TO Invoices.InvoiceLineItems | New PTO (*) _InvoiceLineItems | . | . The Problem . You have created an Imposter PTO in your file! . All seems well, and you‚Äôre happy with your work, until one day down the line you create a new calculation field in the _InvoiceLineItems table‚Ä¶to discover that the default Calculation context in the calculation dialog is Invoices.InvoiceLineItems and not _InvoiceLineItems.üò≥ . Even duplicating a field by copying and pasting the field, causes the Calculation context to change from _InvoiceLineItems to Invoices.InvoiceLineItems üò± . The Solutions . Three solutions are available to you. Avoid the problem . The best solution is to avoid the problem by adopting the Golden Rule . Always use the very first TO as the PTO! . If, on the other hand, you can‚Äôt avoid a potenital Imposter PTO due to a table import, then you must weigh up the two options: . | Replace the imposter PTO with a newer TO | Just live with it. | . Living with an Imposter PTO . An imposter PTO is not such a problem, if you remain aware of it and take precautions: . When living with an Imposter PTO, always take care to correct the calculation context when creating new fields or pasting fields into the table. Replacing the Imposter PTO . To remove the Imposter TO you must . | Duplicate the PTO Imposter (the related TO) | Change all references from the old TO to the new TO | Delete the old TO | . Like this, the new TO gets a higher internal ID than the Imposter TO, so that the Imoster TO becomes the new PTO. ",

While fmTextSeries, fmTextConverter, fmTextMultiplier and fmTextDiff form the core of the text tools category, there are a few more tools hidden around the place that should be mentioned here: . | fmCheckMate has a built in text result viewer, which has a few very handy text functions . | tabulated text view . | just add a separator line (a single dash) after the field name line and look at it in the HTML view | . | Text stats . | On the final tab you can find an analysis of the text ‚Äòs EOL characters and utf-8 multibyte characters, word count and more | . | . | fmSimpleCalculator has some useful functions to discover characters utf-8 or utf-16 multibyte values, and more | Text mate text editor, together with a few Unix commands is also very useful combination for text editing. | .

    "content": "An uphill helter skelter . Introduction . I make tools primarily in my spare time for myself to solve the everyday FileMaker problems that I face as a 24 x 7 x 365 FileMaker developer. Over the years I‚Äôve produced quite a collection of tools that I use every day in my FileMaker development work. Looking back at the history of these tools- which is well documented in the tools‚Äô history comments - I can see that they have evolved very much over time, and that they have been shaped and fed by the problems I have encountered in my daily work. Once you‚Äôve read the history here, you may be interested in the Making of the History of MrWatson‚Äôs Tools, which is a detailed look at how I track this information. The image above shows an analysis of the history comments in the change log (first script) of all my tools - up to 2021. The size of the circles represents the number of comments in the code, and the lines between the circles represent the connections between the tools. The analysis shows that the tools have evolved over time, and that they have been shaped by the problems I have encountered in my daily work. 2006 The Phoenix rises from the Ashes . I finally found my footing in the German FileMaker Community, and with Jens Teich did a presentation on the new custom functions in FileMaker at the FileMaker Conference in Chiemsee. In 2006 I was beginning to dabble in AppleScript as a glue between FileMaker and other applications. 2007 AutoHotkey . Back then I was still mainly working on Windows computers. I was using AutoHotkey to automate repetitive tasks in FileMaker, and I was also using it to create custom keyboard shortcuts for FileMaker. 2008 A murky beginning . The first of my tools was fmDBAnalyser - an instant-analysis tool utilising the FileMaker Design Functions to query the structure of neighbouring databases. Many of the functions in fmDBAnalyser are covered better by other tools these days (for example the MBS plugin let‚Äôs you see internal IDs directly within the FileMaker GUI), but the relationship analysis and diffing still plays a very important role today when moving tables between files. My interest in the FileMaker Clipboard grew. I discovered FMCliboardBroker - originally an AppleScript Clipboard converter from japanese company Key Planning. 2011 Things start taking off . As you can see from the diagramme of changes above, it was 2011 where I really got started. (At least, that‚Äôs when I started documenting changes.üòâ) . fmDBAnalyser was the main focus at the start, but fmLogAnalyser soon came into being . At the end of 2011 I joined GitHub because I felt it was a good thing‚Ä¶but it was 6 1/2 years before I first took a real bite! . 2012 Things started snowballing . fmWorkMate and fmCheckMate took off in 2012. Along with them came the text tools, shortly after followed by more and more tools. 2012 fmSyntaxColorizer . 2012 the text tools started fmTextMultiplier, fmTextSeries, fmTextConverter . 2013 The year for fmSyntaxColorizer . | December 2012 MBS Version 3.0 Component: SyntaxColoring | October 2013 MBS Line Numbers in Scripts | November 2013 MBS Variable Checking | December 2013 MBS Version 3.5 with improvements in Syntax Colorising inc. Line numbers and Variable Checking! | . 2013 was the year of the first dotfmp conference in Hamburg. I was there, and I was inspired by the spirit of sharing and learning. I was also inspired by the idea of open source, and I started to think about how I could contribute to the community. 2013 fmPasteMate, fmPluginMate, fmTextDiff . More tools were thrown into the fmWorkMate toolbox . 2014 fmClipboardViewer, fmSimpleCalculator (own file) . fmClipboardViewer was added to the fmWorkMate toolbox to help visualise and debug the clipboard contents. fmSimpleCalculator - in the toolbox from the start - got a starter file of it‚Äôs own in the same year. 2014 fmPluginInfo . was never released :-/ . 2015 fmModifierKeys . 2016 fmWorkMate Overview . This is how the system looked back in 2016 - schematic like a CPU chip. That‚Äôs a pretty cool diagramme of the TPU / Text Processing Unit! . And the magic of the MBS plugin is well represented. March 2016 MBS 6.1 FM.DataType . MBS provides us with a great new function to get the data type of a value: `MBS( ‚ÄúFM.DataType‚Äù ; value ) . Wrapped in a custom function, this is a great way to get the data type of a value in FileMaker: . MBS proves again to be lightyears ahead of Claris / FileMaker! . Note to self: Not everything is text! . 2016 fmTouchBar &amp; MBS 6.5 TouchBar . First came the new MacBook Pro with TouchBar, then the MBS plugin made functions to programme it. ‚Ä¶and then came fmTouchBar, an app to experiment with the TouchBar functions. Time and UX never meant it never quite caught on and remained experimental. 2017 fmKeyPress . LOL! The first change log entry in fmKeyPress says it all: . 20170120 MrW 0.1v0 Tiny and finy. And that it is - just a very tiny and very fine little app to do just one thing: show you the code of the key you just pressed. 2017 fmLatencyMeter . It was a time of home office and bad internet connections. So I created fmLatencyMeter to help me visualise and measure the latency of the connection. To tell the truth it was actually a test app to show how you can use fmTextMultiplier to create a lot of objects on the clipboard - in this case the dots of the circle. 2017 PSBN / Perform Script by Name . FileMaker 16 focussed on supporting external APIs - connecting FileMaker and the WWW with tons of functions: cURL, JSON, Text &amp; HexEncoding, Cryptography, etc. -&gt; fantastic! . ‚Ä¶Yet it was still not possible to build an internal, ‚Äòloose‚Äô API - from FileMaker file to FileMaker file. FileMaker 15 had only hard coded file-references, script calls bound by internal IDs from list and Plugin functions, which could only perform scripts ASYNCHRONOUSLY (i.e. add it to the script stack, and never be able to get a ScriptResult back)‚Ä¶ . Although Perform Script by Name was introduced later, thanks to the dynamic File References introduced in FM 16 - and some crazy programming from MrWatson (including a ton of automatically generated code), it became possible to realize a dream - Perform Script by Name, natively and synchronously . 2017 fmScriptWorkspace . 2018 My First Commit to Github . My first commit to GitHub was the fmCheckMate-XSLT library on the 6th June 2018, in total 411 files. Over the next 7 years 62 commits have added nearly another 100 funcions to the library! . 2019 fmAutoMate, fmKillDefaultFields . 2019 fmSetupAssistant . Presented in 2023 Rome FileMaker Week . First real use in 2025 during the backporting of G√ºnther Business Solutions‚Äô e-Rechnung module. 2020 fmLaunchPad - We have lift off! . So it was written in the change log: 20200928 @mrwatson-de v0.1 We have lift off! . 2020 fmMetaMate . 2021 dotfmp ‚ÄúWe share because we can!‚Äù . | demise of runtime solutions | . fmWorkMate goes open-source at dotfmp 2021. The main question was: What (open source) licence to use? . 2022 fmIDE . Wow! . 2022 fmUrlDecode . Tired with the slow downloading from the Claris ETS website, I needed a solution to download the files with a fast downloader app. The problem was I needed to feed it the direct url to the file, and that was encoded as a url parameter. =&gt; I created fmUrlDecode . 2024 fmThings . 20240219 @mrwatson-de v0.1 Start of a crazy dream . 2024 3 years and 800 commits later . A tweet in June 2024 fondly looks back on the open source journey thus far. Fondly remembering what #dotfmp has given us over the years: &quot;we share because we can!&quot; 3 years ago I popped the big question in the main hall: What (open source) licence?Since then I&#39;ve mode 800 contributions to GitHub.

He demonstrated how to build modular widgets using callback scripts, which allow a module to call scripts in another file to handle events. While callback scripts provide a better solution than timer scripts, he noted that using Perform Script by Name to call scripts across files is currently a proof of concept and not guaranteed in production systems if script IDs get too high.‚Äù . https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/fmk2017-modularity-in-filemaker-16-by-russell-watson/80847033 .
