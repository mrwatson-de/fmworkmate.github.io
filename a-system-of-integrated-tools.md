Developed over [many years](the-history-of-mrwatsons-tools.html) to [solve real-world problems](solutions-to-daily-problems.html), MrWatson's tools have come to cover a wide range of tasks and problems that I and many other FileMaker developers encounter regularly during their daily routine.

The tools can solve problems

- during setup of a FileMaker workplace computer
- throughout all aspects of the development process
- when analysing and debugging databases
- during deployment and patching
- with integrating documentation

They have [common navigation](navigation-menus-keys.html), a kind of geeky common look and feel, they are designed to work together efficiently.
