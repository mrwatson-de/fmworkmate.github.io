### {{page.title}}

{{page.strapline}}

So this page is for me to help me get this website right. But you might be interested so it's available in the menu.

## Jekyll

I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build this website, together with the [Just the Docs](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/just-the-docs) [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/), great for creating documentation websites.

Jekyll is pretty cool! ðŸ˜Ž

## GitHub Pages

I'm using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host this website - and it lets you both host your website for free *and* publish it via your own domain!

GitHub and GitHub Pages are great! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Visual Studio Code

[VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my editor of choice, and [I'm using the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extension to help me write Markdown.] - actually NOT - but VS-Code's co-pilot suggested it, so maybe I'll leave this here till I have time to check it out! :D

VS-Code is mega cool! ðŸ¤©

## fmImage

To tweak images to the right size I've made a little tool fmImage that lets me import images and create thumbnails with FileMaker.

fmImage is meh! ðŸ˜•

â€¦but maybe one day it'll become another great free tool from me for you! :D
