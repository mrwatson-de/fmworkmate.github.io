So this page is for me to help me get this website right. But you might be interested so it's available in the menu.

![Jekyll](/assets/images/jekyll.png)

## Jekyll

I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build this website, together with the [Just the Docs](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/just-the-docs) [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/), great for creating documentation websites.

Jekyll is pretty cool! ðŸ˜Ž

## GitHub Pages

I'm using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host this website - and it lets you both host your website for free *and* publish it via your own domain!

GitHub and GitHub Pages are great! ðŸ˜ƒ

![Visual Studio Code](/assets/images/vscode.png){: .float-front-right .w-64}

## Visual Studio Code

[VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my editor of choice, and if you have not used it, you should try.Indeed it is the hero of interactive development environments and the inspiration for fmIDE.

VS-Code is mega cool! ðŸ¤©

![ChatGPT](/assets/images/chatgpt.png){: .float-front-right .w-64}

## ChatGPT & Co

Of course to help me learn all the skills and get out of the technical dead ends that one inevitabily lands in  I'm using ChatGPT and GitHub's Copilot.

ChatGPT helps with the image creation and teaching me technologies very adroitly. Copilot is extremly useful for recommending and applying edits to web code. 

There's a lot more to learn in this area, and I'll post anything useful I find here.

![fmImage](/assets/images/tool-icon-256-x-256.png){: .float-front-right .w-64}

## fmImage

To tweak images to the right size I've made a little tool fmImage that lets me import images and create thumbnails with FileMaker.

fmImage is meh! ðŸ˜•

â€¦but maybe one day it'll become another great free tool from me for you! :D

![compresspng.com](/assets/images/compresspng-66pc.png){: .float-front-right .w-64}

## compresspng.com

I use [compresspng.com](https://compresspng.com/) to compress PNG images, and it works great, on average reducing file sizes to about 1/3 their original size without noticeable loss of quality.
