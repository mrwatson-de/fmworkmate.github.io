## Using Git / GitHub Desktop to contribute...

> Need to clear up the best way of doing this, since FileMaker files and GitHub don't work great together.

Basically:

- Create yourself a GitHub account, if you don't yet have one
- Star &/ Watch your favourite repositories
- Follow @mrwatson-de
- Then...

**If you want to experiment** with the code, or test out using GitHub

- Fork the repo to your own GitHub account (for yourself)
- Clone your repo to your computer
- Play around

**If you have FileMaker code to contribute**...

- Let me know what you have added / changed
- We'll review the changes and work out the best way to integrate them into the master database.

**If you have documentation to contribute**, you can use Git / Github to clone a repository to your local machine

## Cloning a repository to your computer

Do this if you want to contribute changes back to the project.

- Clone the repository to your computer
  - I use
    - the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) app in order to get a pleasant GUI and make it easier 
    - a folder in my documents folder, where I put all my GitHub projects `~/Documents/Git/<repositoryname>`
  - If you are using the git command line, good luck!

> Note: Since FileMaker files change every time you open them:
>
> - I tend to copy the FileMaker file(s) to another directory before opening them
> - I only copy them back to the repo folder if I have really changed them and want to synchronise the changes back to GitHub
> - Like that you avoid commiting the FileMaker file back to the repo when no code has actually changed

- Make changes
- Copy the FileMaker files back to the repo folder
- Make a Pull Request
