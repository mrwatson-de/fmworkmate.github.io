### An Amusing Aside

Those of you lucky enough to be acquainted with the whimsical  offerings of American cartoonist [Gary Larson](https://g.co/kgs/511ZGgU) in [The Far Side](https://www.thefarside.com/) may recognise a certain allusion to his epic [Cow Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_tools#/media/File:Cow_Tools_cartoon.png) cartoon panel. If you are not familiar with this, I recommend take a look, particularly the [apparent confusion the cartoon strip caused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prehistory_of_The_Far_Side#Part_4:_Stimulus.E2.80.93Response:~:text=a%20few%20of%20his%20cartoons%20were%20controversial%20simply%20because%20they%20were%20hard%20to%20understand.%20a%20particular%20example%20was%20%22cow%20tools%2C%22). It's a classic!
