The first group of tools in the fmWorkMate toolbox are the `Developer Tools`.

Historically, some of the first tools I made, this group of tools represent the original core of MrWatson's Power Tools for FileMaker developers.

Above all [fmCheckMate](fmcheckmate.html) and the [fmCheckMate XSLT-Library](fmcheckmate-xslt-library.html) along with fmLogAnalyser and the BugOff! Alarm, belong to the tools that get used most every day. .

[fmDBAnalyser](fmdbanalyser.html) is the original analytics tool to 'turn your databases inside out

[fmSyntaxColorizer](fmsyntaxcolorizer.html) is the tool that makes your script workspace come to life with colour, and the first step to extending your FileMaker development environment with MrWatson's tools.

Of course, all my tools are tools for FileMaker developers.

### An Amusing Aside

Those of you lucky enough to be acquainted with the whimsical  offerings of American cartoonist [Gary Larson](https://g.co/kgs/511ZGgU) in [The Far Side](https://www.thefarside.com/) may recognise a certain allusion to his epic [Cow Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_tools#/media/File:Cow_Tools_cartoon.png) cartoon panel. If you are not familiar with this, I recommend take a look, particularly the [apparent confusion the cartoon strip caused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prehistory_of_The_Far_Side#Part_4:_Stimulus.E2.80.93Response:~:text=a%20few%20of%20his%20cartoons%20were%20controversial%20simply%20because%20they%20were%20hard%20to%20understand.%20a%20particular%20example%20was%20%22cow%20tools%2C%22). It's a classic!
