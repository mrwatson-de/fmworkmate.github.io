1. Go to the repository you need on github.
2. If there is a release,
   - go to the latest release page
     - (you'll find a link in the middle of the right hand side of the main page)
   - Scroll to the bottom
   - Download the Zip file
3. or if you want the latest cutting edge update
   - Click the Code button
   - Download the Zip file
