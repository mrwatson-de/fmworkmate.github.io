…everything is **not** as it seems…

So they say.

*But is it really?*

---

    Exit Script [ Text Result: … ]

So it says.

*But is it really, really?*

---

In FileMaker, if you pass an image back from a script do you not get an image in the Script Result?

![Ceci n'est pas du text](/assets/images/ceci-nest-pas-une-pipe-screenshot.png)

Or is the image returned as text, as the `Exit Script` step proclaims?

{: .text-3xl }
🧐

## Everything is really not as it seems…

You will know the truth only if you see it for yourself by downloading the [EverythingIsText repository]({{page.github_latest}}) and inspecting the Script Result in the **vRyThNgStXt** file.

Enjoy - and good luck! 😉
