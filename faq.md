## What plugins do I need?

- Many of MrWatson's tools build on the super functionality of the [MBS Plugin](https://www.monkeybreadsoftware.com/filemaker/).
- Some tools also use the free [BaseElements Plugin] from Goya
- Some of the tools don't use any plugins at all.

Until I get round to documenting this better, just download the two plugins and you'll be fine 

## Do I need an MBS Plugin Licence to use MrWatson's tools?

- Many functions fron the MBS Plugin are free to use (mostly the ['developer goodies'](https://www.mbsplugins.de/archive/2024-01-13/40_Goodies_in_MBS_Plugin/monkeybreadsoftware_blog_filemaker)).
- However, some functions require a licence, and some of thoase functions are used in MrWatson's tools.
- On the other hand, as the websoite says '**You can always start with no license (Demo mode) or a time limited trial license key.**'

## How do I get a licence for the MBS Plugin?

Check out the [MBS Plugin prices page](https://www.monkeybreadsoftware.com/filemaker/pricing.shtml) or the [Plugin License Decision Graph](https://www.mbsplugins.de/archive/2021-01-01/Plugin_License_Decision_Graph/monkeybreadsoftware_blog_filemaker) for details on how to get a licence.
