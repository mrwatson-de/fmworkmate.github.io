## The Problem

Working in FileMaker can sometimes require an awful lot of clicking to get where you want to go to (and back).

## MrWatson's Solutions

**Many** of MrWatson's tools help you avoid the clicking and get straight to the point.

- When following the script flow between files, *avoid clickeritus* by [Clicking through the Script Flow](click-through-the-script-flow.html)
- When moving code around instead of clicking a thousand layout objects, use MrWatson's tools to [Recontextualise fields and functionality](recontextualise-code.html)
- When trying to [get the big picture of how a table works](how-does-this-table-work.html) avoid field definition clickeritus by using [fmGraphIt]
