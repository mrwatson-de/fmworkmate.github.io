Just paste the scripts of the fmAM module to your file and you will get extra cool functions *automatically* appearing in your fmAutoMate context menus.

Above all the `Omit Matching Records` is an outstanding function - it has pride of place in the toolbelt as the chisel does for a sculptor.

With it you can 'sculpt' a highly complicated found set without ever leaving browse mode.
