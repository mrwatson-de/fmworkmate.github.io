## Introduction

- Need to transfer some FileMaker code from here to there across the internet quick?
- Wanna copy and paste your FileMaker code between two FileMaker solutions - and it just doesn't work?

## The Problem

- Copy and paste **doesn't work for FileMaker code.** (at least not from a Mac.)
- **However**, copy and paste **does work for text.** (most of the time)

That means, if we can convert our FileMaker code to xml on the clipboard, we are ready to transfer our code across the etherâ€¦

## MrWatson's Solutions

Two solutions help bridge the divide:

[fmCheckmate](./fmcheckmate.html) is **quick** (particularly if you use [fmCheckMate's Convert & Transfer Mode](fmcheckmate-modes.html)):

### Copy Code from here to there with fmCheckMate (Mac to Win)

1. <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>
   : **Copy** your code from the FileMaker solution here
2. <kbd>âŒ¥</kbd><kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>
   : **Convert** the code here to fmxml on the clipboard with fmCheckMate
3. <kbd>âŒƒ</kbd><kbd>âŒ¥</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>
   : **Convert** back to FileMaker Objects with fmCheckMate there
4. <kbd>âŒƒ</kbd><kbd>V</kbd>
   : **Paste** the code into the FileMaker solution there

### Copy Code from there to here with fmCheckMate (Win to Mac)

1. <kbd>âŒƒ</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>
   : **Copy** your code from the FileMaker solution there
2. <kbd>âŒƒ</kbd><kbd>âŒ¥</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>
   : **Convert** the code here to fmxml on the clipboard with fmCheckMate
3. <kbd>âŒ¥</kbd><kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>
   : **Convert** back to FileMaker Objects with fmCheckMate here
4. <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>V</kbd>
   : **Paste** the code into the FileMaker solution here

[fmAutoMate](./fmautomate.html)'s Xopy + PaXte  is **blitz schnell**:

When the local and remote machines are both Macs, you can use fmAutoMate's Xopy + PaXte to copy code between them:

1. <kbd>âŒƒ</kbd><kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>
   : **Xopy** the code from the FileMaker solution here
2. <kbd>âŒƒ</kbd><kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>V</kbd>
   : **PaXte** the code into the FileMaker solution there
