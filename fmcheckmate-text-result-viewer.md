### Introduction

fmCheckMate's text result viewer shows the results of an analysis, or of any transformation that produces a text result. It is a simple viewer, but it has some powerful features that make it more than just a viewer.

Note: You can always return to the viewer by 

- Selecting `XML Editor > Show Last Text Result` (<kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>T</kbd>)
