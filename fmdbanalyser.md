fmDBAnalyser is a tool which can provide an instant analysis of the currently open FileMaker databases around it.

Being [one of the first tools I made for FileMaker](the-history-of-mrwatsons-tools.html#2008-a-murky-beginning) many of the functions are outstripped these days by other analysis tools, yet the relationship analysis function is still extremely useful when transferring tables between files.

See [Importing a table perfectly](import-a-table-perfectly.html) and the case study [Backporting an e-Invoice Solution for GBS GmbH](case-study-backporting-e-invoice-solution-gbs.html) to see how it can be used to verify the relationships of a TOG.
