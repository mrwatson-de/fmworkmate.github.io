fmIDE, the successor to [fmScriptWorkspace](fmscriptworkspace.html), not only gives you direct access to the ScriptWorkspace, but opens up the entirety of the FileMaker development environment - via the fmIDE Name That Thing API - plus fmIDE packs a [powerful action interpreter](https://github.com/fmIDE/fmIDE/wiki/fmIDE-Action-Scripts) for *dynamic scripting* - also, to some extent, within the developer environment.

## The fmIDE Name That Thing API

…opens up the entirety of the FileMaker development environment - like a rainbow opens up your heart…

## Basic Installation

The basic installation process is simple, just…

1. Paste the fmIDE Module into your main solution file
2. If necessary, tweak it to account for your strange table / 'base layout' naming conventions
3. Copy & paste the tweaked fmIDE Module to all other files in your solution
4. Grant full access users the privilege to accept fmpurls - extended privilege `fmurlscript`

…and you are ready to go!

For further details read the [full installation instructions](https://github.com/fmide/fmide/wiki/About-fmIDE-Installation-and-Setup) on the [fmIDE Wiki](https://github.com/fmide/fmide/wiki).
