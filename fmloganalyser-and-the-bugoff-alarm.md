fmLogAnalyser's BugOff! Alarm **tells you when something breaks** when pasting code into a FileMaker solution.

It monitors the import.log file, and when an error occurs fmLogAnalyser is brought to your attention, so you can fix it immediately and tick it off in.

## Don't let the bugs in!

You can keep the bugs out of your database by setting up fmWorkMate and fmLogAnalyser to turn on the BugOff! Alarm automatically at start:

1. Set up fmLogAnalyser to turn the BugOff! Alarm automatically
2. Set up fmWorkMate to start fmLogAnalyser automatically.
