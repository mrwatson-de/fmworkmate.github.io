This little utility helps you find out which version of MBS Plugin you need for your code - and it's pretty flexible!

## What Version of MBS does this code need?

You can feed it

- a single `MBS ( "function" )` call
- an entire calculation
- a whole script text, for example copied straight from the [MBS website](https://www.mbsplugins.eu/XLBookAddConditionalFormat.shtml)

You can even feed itâ€¦

- script clipboard XML
  - just copy the scripts you want to check
  - the insert button will automatically convert to XML for you
- a dump of the *entire* database
  - as Save as XML
  - or as DDR

Yes! You can discover the minimum MBS version *for an entire solution* in moments!
