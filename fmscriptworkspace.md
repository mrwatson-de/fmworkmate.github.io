`fmScriptWorkspace`, the predecessor of [fmIDE], is a module to let you access the FileMaker ScriptWorkspace, directly open scripts and show or select specific script steps.

It has one redeeming feature over and above fmIDE, and that is it works also for non full-access users, making it possible for you to open scripts for users who have script editing rights.

It is available for download on the [fmScriptWorkspace GitHub Repository](http://github.com/mrwatson-de/fmScriptWorkspace).
