The new sandwich function in fmTextMultiplier is a game changer. It allows you to multiply the contents of your ButtonBars, Sliders and TabControls.

When you insert one of these layout object types, the sandwich icon appears, something like this:

Press it to 'open up the sandwich' and remove the outer layer of the object. This will reveal the contents of the object allowing you to multiply up the contents.

Once you have multiplied the contents, you can 'close the sandwich' by pressing the ultimate-sandwich icon at the bottom right corner of the page.

You can see the sandwich pieces on the sandwich popover:

- `[Close Sandwich]` puts the bread around the contents again (without multiplying the innards), 
- `[Clear Sandwich]` 'throws away the bread'
- or you can manually edit the xml if needed
