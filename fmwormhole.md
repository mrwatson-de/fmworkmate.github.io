Get files from A to B through the wormhole in space.

### Problem

Sometimes simply transferring files from one computer to another on a remote system is a PITA.

Drives and mounts and access rights and all that stuff, you know?

### Solution

All the machines that I'm interested in can reach the FileMaker Sever, so I made a FileMaker solution:

fmWormhole
: a simple FileMaker file where you can up- and download files, allowing you to easily transfer files from one computer to another through the wormhole in space.

Kind of embarrassingly simple really.

In fact, so embarrassingly simple that I never actually got round to publishing it.

### Never mind!

Here's a pretty picture to give you the idea:
