FileMaker got a great new feature quite a few versions back, where you can <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Click</kbd> on a `Perform Script` script step and it opens the script for you.

This is a **great** feature to help you to follow the script-flow **but…**

## The Problem

…it only works **within one file**.

If you have a *multifile* solution, where scripts jump between files, I'm afraid you are out of luck!

## MrWatson's Solution

Just add a little of MrWatson's tonic, wave your magic wand - <kbd>⌃⌘O</kbd> - and `Open Sesame`! the script will magically open for you.

The tonic you need is

- [fmAutoMate](./fmautomate.html) 
- [fmIDE](./fmide.html)!
- and, of course, [the MBS Plugin](./mbs-plugin.html)

fmAutoMate extends the FileMaker development environment to provide extra menu items and keyboard shortcuts to make your life easier.

fmIDE (a FileMaker Integrated Devlopment Environment) is a script/script module that you can add to your solution to provide unbelievable power to your development environment.
