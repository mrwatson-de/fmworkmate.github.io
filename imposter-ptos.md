Have you ever added a new field to a table only to find that the calculation context is not what you expected?

![Example Imposter PTO](/assets/images/imposter-pto-old.png)

This can be quite problematic, since, with the wrong calculation context, the calculation can produce quite incorrect results.

{: .mrw-gold-bg}
**PTO** = **P**rimary **T**able **O**ccurence = the 'main' table occurence

It's also quite unepected and confusingâ€¦because, taking a look at the relationship graph, everything appears to be alright:



![The Relationship Graph seems alright](/assets/images/imposter-pto-relationship-graph.png)

- You can see the `PTO` which is used for your layouts - in this case the `_Mandanten` TO with the underscore at the start
- and the other 'related TOs' - with the table name 'Mandant' at the end.

[At GBS we have a naming convention that prefixes the base table and the PTO with an underscore, so that the PTO is always the first TO in the table picker list.]

All seems well, but clearly it is not.

So, what's going on?

## The Problem

{: .mrw-red-bg }
The problem is you have (passively or actively) created an Imposter PTO in your file!

â€¦either through negligence or as a product of resturcturing your database.

What are Imposter PTOs?

A `PTO` - the Primary Table Occurence of a table - isâ€¦

- the TO you ususally use for layouts
- the TO that you expect to appear in the calculation context of a calculation field
- however, it must be the base table's *first* TO created in the file

On the other hand, an `Imposter PTO` isâ€¦

- a TO that *looks* like it's the primary table occurence of a table (according to your naming conventions), butâ€¦
- it *is not* the first TO in the file.

 So here you see (what you think is) the PTO at the bottom left plus a couple of related TOs.


![The Relationship Graph seems alright](/assets/images/imposter-pto-relationship-graph-p-t-oh.png)


This typically occurs

- when the developer is inattentive and accidentally uses the first TO as a related TO to some other table
- when a table is imported into a file, where a refernce to the table already exists as a related TO to some other table

## So what?

What are the consequences of having an Imposter PTO?

Imposter PTOs can cause problems with calculations in new fields, because the default calculation context is not the TO you expect it to be.

This is best illustrated with an example:

## User Story: Imposter PTO caused by Refactoring the Database

Say

- your naming practice is to prefix your BaseTables and PTOs with an underscore
- you initially have two files to store your invoice data

This may be the inital set up

1. File `Invoices.fmp12`

   - base table `_Invoices`
   - PTO `_Invoices`
   - related TO `Invoices.InvoiceLineItems`

2. File `InvoiceLineItems.fmp12`

   - base table `_InvoiceLineItems`,
   - PTO `_InvoiceLineItems`
   - related TO `InvoicesLineItems.Invoice`

At first all is well and good, but some day the double work of maintaining two files becomes too much overhead and you decide to refactor your database and put everything into the `Invoices.fmp12` file.

You do this by

- [importing the `InvoiceLineItems` table perfectly](import-a-table-perfectly.html) into the `Invoices.fmp12` file.
- Copying the layout + script code over to the `Invoices.fmp12` file
- Removing all references to the `InvoicesLineItems` file
- Deleting the `InvoicesLineItems` file
- Testing and fixing (mostly, `Go to Related Record` steps where the Target Layout has broken)

The structure you now have is like this:

1. File `Invoices.fmp12`

   - base table `_Invoices`
   - PTO `_Invoices`
   - related TO `Invoices.InvoiceLineItems`
   - New PTO (*) `_InvoiceLineItems`

## The Problem

{: .mrw-red-bg }
You have created an Imposter PTO in your file!

All seems well, and you're happy with your work, until one day down the line you create a new calculation field in the `_InvoiceLineItems` tableâ€¦to discover that the default Calculation context in the calculation dialog is `Invoices.InvoiceLineItems` and not `_InvoiceLineItems`.ðŸ˜³

Even duplicating a field by copying and pasting the field, causes the Calculation context to change from `_InvoiceLineItems` to `Invoices.InvoiceLineItems` ðŸ˜±

## The Solutions

Three solutions are available to you.

### Avoid the problem

The best solution is to **avoid the problem** by adopting the Golden Rule

{: .mrw-golden-rule}
Always use the very first TO as the PTO!

If, on the other hand, you can't avoid a potenital Imposter PTO due to a table import, then you must weigh up the two options:

1. Replace the imposter PTO with a newer TO
2. Just live with it.

### Living with an Imposter PTO

An imposter PTO is not such a problem, if you remain aware of it and take precautions:

{: .mrw-golden-rule}
When living with an Imposter PTO, always take care to correct the calculation context when creating new fields or pasting fields into the table.

### Replacing the Imposter PTO

To remove the Imposter TO you must

1. Duplicate the PTO Imposter (the related TO)
2. Change all references from the old TO to the new TO
3. Delete the old TO

Like this, the new TO gets a higher internal ID than the Imposter TO, so that the Imoster TO becomes the new PTO.
