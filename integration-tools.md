If you want an integrated development environment in FileMaker then MrWatson's Integration Tools is the place to start.

[fmAutoMate] is the pioneer of integration tools in FileMaker.

With the help of the MBS plugin it brings power to your fingertips - literally - in the form of keyboard shortcuts and context menus to a plethora of functions. The functions where and when you need them!
Here and now!

[fmIDE] is the mother of integration tools.

Plug fmIDE into your files to get a powerful API that tools can speak to in order to reach - and manipulate - the things, the scripts, the fields, the value lists, the building blocks of your database. 

[fmScriptWorkspace], the predecessor of fmIDE, gives access to the Script Workspace. Open scripts, select specific script steps, and fix your bugs in an instant!

[fmLaunchPad] integrates FileMaker files into your Mac's app environment. It's an intelligent file starter. 

[fmSyntaxColorizer] is also integration tool, my first, and to be found under [Developer Tools](developer-tools.html)
