Tasks in FileMaker can sometimes be quite repetitive and tedious, like… 

- renaming stuff on multiple layouts,
- fixing a universal error in multiple scripts and files,
- patching a bunch of code to a bunch of deployments

…wouldn't it be great to have a ninja sword to slice times in half and turn tedium to treasure?

MrWatson's tools have been designed both for repetitive tasks and for power users.

The fmWorkMate toolbox has been architected to be as efficient as possible in these situations, so that power users can take advantage of the keyboard shortcuts and integrated tools to 

When you get into the swing of things - `get into the zone` - you can **annihilate a task** in a fraction of the time it would take you to do it manually.

## The Most Awesome Killer Keyboard shortcuts

Use these shortcuts to become the most awesome FileMaker power developer:

### 1. fmWorkMate´s Double-Whammy Kick Start Keys

For fmWorkMate's main tools the keyboard shortcut for the main action is the same to open them.

For example, from fmWorkMate…

{: .mrw-killer-bg}
- to **open fmCheckMate** and **convert the current clipboard** - just press <kbd>⌘2</kbd> <kbd>⌘2</kbd>
- to **open fmTextDiff** and **diff the current clipboard** - just press <kbd>⌘7</kbd> <kbd>⌘7</kbd>

See the complete list on the [Navigation, Menus and Keys](navigation-menus-keys.html#fmworkmate-killer-keys) Page.

### 2. fmAutoMate´s magical Xopy-n-PaXte keys

To transfer code between FileMaker solutions from Mac to Mac across the ether using [fmAutoMate](fmautomate.html), you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

{% capture killer-keys %}

In the local FileMaker
: <kbd>⌃⌘C</kbd> to Xopy the code from the local FileMaker as XML

(-
: the code is magically transferred as XML text :-)

In the remote FileMaker
: <kbd>⌃⌘V</kbd> to PaXte the code into the remote FileMaker
