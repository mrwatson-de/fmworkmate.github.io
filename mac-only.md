I'm afraid, Windows users, much of the [MrWatson's Tools] functionality is Mac only and is not going to be coming to a Windows computer near you any time soon, indeed almost certainly never.

The reason for this is that many of my tools build on functionality of the [MBS Plugin] which in turn leverages the Mac OS to provide functionality that is not available in Windows.

This does not mean that you cannot get something out of my tools - Many tools & functions DO work on Windows, just not all of them.
