It goes without saying, nothing tastes quite as good as MonkeyBread and the MBS Plugin. It is the Swiss Army knife of FileMaker development - and most times at the core of [MrWatson's Tools] and solutions.

As a FileMaker developer, you will find the [MBS Plugin](https://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/filemaker/) to be an invaluable tool. It is a collection of over 6000 functions that allow you to extend FileMaker's capabilities in ways that are not possible with FileMaker alone.
