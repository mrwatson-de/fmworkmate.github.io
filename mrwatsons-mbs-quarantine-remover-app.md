If you use the MBS Plugin and work closely together with Christian Schmitz on an issue in the plugin, you may find yourself getting a development version of the plugin.

Such plugins are not notarized and need to be cleared of its quarantine flag before you are able to use it.

Whilst Christian supplies great [instructions on how to do this](https://www.monkeybreadsoftware.com/filemaker/builds/Mac/Remove%20Quarantine%20Readme.pdf) in the Terminal, it's still fiddly and, well, terminal.

`MrWatson's MBS Quarantine Remover` App is a simple little drag drop Automator app, which you can just drop the plugin on to do the work for you.

To do - Where can you get it?
