One of the greatest [advantages of MrWatson's tools](why-mrwatsons-tools.html) over many other FileMaker tools, is that they work in the same way that you work, they work in the way you want them to[^1]

- in bite sized chunks
- at your fingertips
- here and now

Many other tools work by devouring the FileMaker SaveAsXML XML or the DDR - and that takes time to generate. The rhythm of those tools is in hours or minutes.

The Claris Updater tool - whilst doing a fantastic job of changing FileMaker databases in workflow pipelines - only works on non-hosted databases. So, hands up everybody who develops locally?

MrWatson's Tools, on the other hand, work with the clipboard, with the thing directly in front of you, with the thing 'in your hand'. They concentrate on solving the little problems, one by one, in harmony, powerfully,  efficiently and immediately.
