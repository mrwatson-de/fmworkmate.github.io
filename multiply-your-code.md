In my experience there are many moments in my FileMaker development day where I have written a little bit of code, and I need to do exacly the same with this whole bunch of fields" (or scripts, or repetitions, â€¦)

I've often found myself wishfully thinking 

> "If only I could multiply this little bit of code up, without having to click through all the settings for each field.

> "If I could use this code as a pattern and then apply this list of fields to it, that would save a **lot** of time!"
