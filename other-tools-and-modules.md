- MrWatsons MBS Quarantine Remover.app
  - If you work closely together with Christian Schmitz, or need (to test) the latest cutting edge development version of the MBS plugin, you may find yourself needing to remove the quarantine attribute on the MBS plugin file on a Mac.
  - Whilst Christian publishes the [instructions on how to do this](https://www.monkeybreadsoftware.com/filemaker/builds/Mac/Remove%20Quarantine%20Readme.pdf), it is still fiddly and a lot easier to do it with MrWatsons MBS Quarantine Remover, which is an Automator workflow to do the same.

  - If you are interested, ask me about it.
