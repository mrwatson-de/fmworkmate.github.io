**Don't leave things to chance**, don't scan through code to see if it right, **check scientifically to test for zero errors and prove you are right!**

There's no better buzz!

## import.log and [fmLogAnalyser]

Have you imported scripts into a file, or inserted some steps into a script? or pasted some fields into a table?

In these cases FileMaker writes to the `import.log` file.

However, since this is nearly unreadable  you can use [fmLogAnalyser] to check if any errors occurred.

Have you pasted something into a layout, and want to check if it has broken?

## How to port code and prove you are right

Here is an overview of which methods to use when porting different things:
