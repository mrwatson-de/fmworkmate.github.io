### Problem

Have you got some fields nicely arranged in a portal but you now need to have the same fields shown in a new list layout?

You can copy and paste the fields to the new list layout, but the problem is

- you need to change the TO of every field to the LayoutTable / PTO
- …and every calculation - conditional formatting condition, hide calculation, tip or placeholder calculation also needs to be changed?
- …and every button script parameter also may need changing?

Bummer!

### Solution

Use fmCheckMate to rename all the TO references in a single



### Alternatively

- Use fmAutoMate to recontextualise in situ
