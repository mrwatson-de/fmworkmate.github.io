## Introduction

I guess it is good to know where you are going, eh?

Here are some things in the pipeline. Ideas, vague plans, pie in the sky. As ever no promises, no guarantees!

- [fmGraphIt]
  - a tool which explains how to quickly make a dependency graph of fields in a table.
  - currently has the form of a description of the process on this website
  - Would a FileMaker file make this more concrete?
- [fmAutoMate] - ChatGPT or AI Agent integration – it would be **soooo** cool!
- [fmLog357] - a modular logging tool for FileMaker. Also sleeping a bit. But used in action…
- [fmIDE] for all – open up to non-full-access users? Needs a discussion…
  - if fmIDE can be safely opened up to use by non-full-access users, as its action engine is so powerful and so useful, for example data based Perform Search.
  - if SaveAsXML can be safely opened up for full-access users.
- [fmThings] - an analysis tool, and patch assistant. Currently sleeping a bit.
- [fmWormHole] - a tool to transfer files from one computer to another through the wormhole in space. Anyone interested?
- [fmShortcut] - (an idea for) a tool to manage keyboard shortcuts on Mac computers.
