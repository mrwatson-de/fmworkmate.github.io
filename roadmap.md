## Introduction

I guess it is good to know where you are going, eh?

Here are some things in the pipeline. Ideas, vague plans, pie in the sky. As ever no promises, no guarantees!

- fmAutoMate - ChatGPT integration - it would be **soooo** cool!
- [fmThings](fmThings.html) - an analysis tool, and patch assistant. Currently sleeping a bit.
- [fmLog357](fmLog357.html) - a modular logging tool for FileMaker. Also sleeping a bit.
- [fmGraphIt](fmgraphit.html) - a tool which explains how to quickly make a dependency graph of fields in a table.
- [fmWormHole](fmwormhole.html) - a tool to transfer files from one computer to another through the wormhole in space. Anyone interested?
