## Introduction

I guess it is good to know where you are going, eh?

Here are some things in the pipeline. Ideas, vague plans, pie in the sky. As ever no promises, no guarantees!

- [fmAutoMate](fmAutoMate.html) - ChatGPT or AI Agent integration – it would be **soooo** cool!
- [fmIDE](fmIDE.html) for all – open up to non-full-access users? Needs a discussion…
  - if fmIDE can be safely opened up to use by non-full-access users, as its action engine is so powerful and so useful, for example data based Perform Search.
  - if SaveAsXML can be safely opened up for full-access users.
- [fmThings](fmThings.html) - an analysis tool, and patch assistant. Currently sleeping a bit.
- [fmLog357](fmLog357.html) - a modular logging tool for FileMaker. Also sleeping a bit.
- [fmGraphIt](fmgraphit.html) - a tool which explains how to quickly make a dependency graph of fields in a table.
- [fmWormHole](fmwormhole.html) - a tool to transfer files from one computer to another through the wormhole in space. Anyone interested?
- [fmShortcut](fmshortcut.html) - (an idea for) a tool to manage keyboard shortcuts on Mac computers.
