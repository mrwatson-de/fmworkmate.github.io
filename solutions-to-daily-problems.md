### We are Problem Solvers

> We are FileMaker developers. We are problem solvers, right?

Yep, and in my daily work I often find myself solving the same problems over and over again. Sometimes silly little problems, sometimes huge problems needing all the skills and tools of the trade.

### And Solution Sharers

My tools are my solutions to all the problems I get in my daily work, and since we [share the same platform](claris-filemaker.html) we very probably *share the same problems* in our daily FileMaker development, I can share my solutions to your great advantage :D

If there was one thing we learned from [dotfmp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpvtoyie8-1vZd7pW-wEICA/videos), it was

'We share because we can!'

So, take a look through the problems listed here, and see if you can't find a solution to make your daily routine better, more productive and [more fun](why-mrwatsons-tools.html#fun) than ever before!
