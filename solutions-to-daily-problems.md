### We are Problem Solvers

We are FileMaker developers. We are problem solvers, right? Yep, and in my daily work I often find myself solving the same problems over and over again. Sometimes silly little problems, sometimes huge problems needing all the skills and tools of the trade.

My tools are my solution to all the problems I get in my daily work - and very probably solutions to the problems you get in your daily FileMaker work too! So, take a look through the problems listed here, and see if you can't find a solution to make your daily routine better, more productive and more fun!

### Show me your Problem, I'll show you my Solution

Here are some of the problems I've faced and the solutions I've found. I hope you find them useful too!
