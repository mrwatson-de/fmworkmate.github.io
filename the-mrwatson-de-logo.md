> Hey, MrWatson, what's the meaning of your logo, bro'?

Wellâ€¦

- It's a cool neon sign
- It's a traffic light
- It's systematic
- It's modular
- It's nerdy
- It's icons
- It's text
- It's fun
- It's me

Get it?

## ![Stop](/assets/images/mrwatson-de-1-stop.png){: .w-32 .mt-32} Stop

- Go back
- Don't let the junk in
- Say no!

## ![Get Ready](/assets/images/mrwatson-de-2-get-ready.png){: .w-32 .mt-32} Get Ready

- Tweak it baby
- Weed out the rubbish

## ![Go](/assets/images/mrwatson-de-3-go.png){: .w-32 .mt-32} Go!

- We're ready to fly!
- Let's play!

## My Dirty Little Secret

Now, here's the secret, fun bit:

{: .mrw-gold-bg}

MrWatson's logo is actually just the text "MRw" in the Wingdings3 font

![MrWatson's logo is "MRw" in Wingdings3](/assets/images/mrwatsons-logo-is-mrw-in-wingdings3.png)

That means, if you have Wingdings3 installed on your system, you can embed the logo in text and use it easily in emails & documentation:
- Hope you like my text based <span class="wingdings3"><span class="mrw-red">M</span><span class="mrw-orange">R</span><span class="mrw-green">w</span></span> logo!
  - <span class="wingdings3 mrw-red">M</span> Stop
  - <span class="wingdings3 mrw-orange">R</span> Get Ready
  - <span class="wingdings3 mrw-green">w</span> Go!

That is very cool ðŸ˜Ž - in a very nerdy kind of way! ðŸ¥¸

I told you it's fun ðŸ˜œ

Enjoy!

Now if you are seeing this, you haven't got Wingdings 3 on your system.

To do: where to get it

{: .mrw-gold-bg}

Indeed, you can see the idea in use in the Page Contents box at the top right of the page, where the bullet points are green triangles, but using a unicode triangle instead of Wingdings to avoid the font problem! ðŸ¤©
