Since Claris stopped allowing the FileMaker Server to host files without passwords, [we all chose a secret password 🤣](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHaBH4LqGsI) for the admin account to protect our precious files…

<details>
<summary>…and the secret password is…?</summary>

**User**: `admin`

**Password**: `admin`
</details>

<details>
<summary>Yes, technically,…</summary>
 …the user account is `Admin` with a big `A`, I know, but little `a` also works, and - as the above link so amusingly shows -  we are fundamentally, excrutiatingly - dangerously - simple creatures → so `admin` - `admin` it is!
