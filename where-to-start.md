### TL;DR: fmWorkMate

The simple answer to that question is: 

{% capture fmwm %}

start with [fmWorkMate](fmworkmate.html) - MrWatson's main toolbox of goodies

{% endcapture %}<section class="fullwidth mrw-green-bg">{{ fmwm | markdownify }}</section>

The longer answer to that question is:

{% capture depends %}

where to start depends, of course, on

- where you are going
- what you want to achieve
- and the problems you are facing right now.
{% endcapture %}<section class="fullwidth">{{ depends | markdownify }}</section>
