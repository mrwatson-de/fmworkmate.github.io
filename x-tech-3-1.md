With the introduction of the [MBS Saxon extension] from Saxonica, XML technologies in FileMaker have taken a 💥25💥 year leap into the future!

FileMaker supports XSLT version 1.0 natively - a technology that was introduced **last millenium**. Having been released as a W3C Recommendation in 1999 XSLT first came to FileMaler in Version 7.0 in 2004.

In 2025 - 21 years later - the MBS Plugin integrated the Saxononica XSLT and XQuery library into the plugin.

And this functionality is now integrated into fmWorkMate and fmCheckMate.
