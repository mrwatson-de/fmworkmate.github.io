MBS Plugin has started supporting [Saxon](https://www.mbsplugins.de/archive/2025-01-07/Saxon_in_MBS_FileMaker_Plugin/monkeybreadsoftware_blog_filemaker).

â€¦and Saxon supports 

- XSLT 3.0 for transformations
- XQuery 3.1 for queries
- XSD 1.1 for document validation
- XPath 3.1 for navigation within documents

â€¦and since XQuery is a very powerful language to query and transform XML data, I have built it into fmCheckMate: ðŸ˜ƒ

- fmCheckMate now also supports importing and applying xquery files with the `.xq` or `.xquery` extension.
- Plus the old XPath Query window is now the [XML-Query](/fmcheckmate-xml-query.html) window and supports XPath (old v1.0 still), XSLT and XQuery.



Never heard of XQuery?

Check out the [XQuery Cheatsheet](/xquery-cheatsheet.html) to get up to speed with XQuery.
