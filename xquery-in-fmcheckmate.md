MBS Plugin has started supporting Saxon.

Saxon supports the latest 3.1 version of XPath, XSLT, and XQuery.

Since XQuery is a very powerful language to query and transform XML data, I have built it into fmCheckMate.

- fmCheckMate supports xquery files with the `.xq` extension.
- Plus the old XPath Query window is now the [XML-Query](/fmcheckmate-xml-query.html) window and supports XPath, XSLT and XQuery.

Never heard of XQuery?

Check out the [XQuery Cheatsheet](/xquery-cheatsheet.html) to get up to speed with XQuery.
